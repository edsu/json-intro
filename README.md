This repository contains brief, gentle introductions to JSON for different
programming languages. The idea is to provide a simple introduction to JSON
assuming little to no programming ability. If you'd like to contribute one, or 
modify an existing one pull requests are welcome (that's why it's on GitHub).
If you simply want to copy one of them and update it to use your language of
choice that's perfectly fine.
