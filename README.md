This repository contains brief, gentle introductions to JSON for different
programming languages. The idea is to provide a simple introduction to JSON
assuming little to no programming ability. If you'd like to contribute one, or 
modify an existing one pull requests are welcome (that's why it's on GitHub).
If you simply want to copy one of them and update it to use your language of
choice that's perfectly fine.

This started as a simple lazyweb 
[request](https://twitter.com/edsu/status/619520456383709184) on Twitter, which
didn't turn up much results, after being retweeted fairly wide. The only real
responses were:

* [Introducing JSON](http://www.json.org/) which is great, but is really 
geared for someone who is already comfortable programming. Throwing this
document at someone who is learning to program is kinda like RTFM, no?
* [JSON Tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/json/) which is also good, but is 
oriented around XML and not a programming language. Also it's broken up into 
multiple pages and littered with distracting ads. Sigh.

Fortunately [Scott Pettifer], who is a Lecturer in Computer Science at the University of Machester, [stepped up](https://twitter.com/srp/status/619523126519574528) and started this one.
