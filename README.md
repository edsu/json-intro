## A Gentle Introduction to JSON

This repository contains brief, gentle introductions to JSON for aspiring 
programmers. The idea is to provide a simple introduction to JSON for smart,
motivated people whose primary area of expertise is elsewhere (social sciences,
humanities, etc) and don't necessarily know how to program (yet).

If you'd like to contribute one, or modify an existing one, please send along
a pull request (yay, this is GitHub). One way to do this is to simply copy 
an existing one and update it to use your language of choice.

### Background

This started as a simple lazyweb 
[request](https://twitter.com/edsu/status/619520456383709184) on Twitter, which
didn't turn up much results, after being retweeted fairly wide. The only real
responses were:

* [Introducing JSON](http://www.json.org/) - This is great, but it is really 
geared for someone who is already comfortable programming. Throwing this
document at someone who is learning to program is kinda like RTFM, no?
* [JSON Tutorial](http://www.w3schools.com/json/) which is also good, but is 
oriented around XML instead of a programming language. Also, it's broken up 
into multiple pages and littered with distracting ads. Sigh.

Fortunately [Scott Pettifer], who is a Lecturer in Computer Science at the University of Machester, [stepped up](https://twitter.com/srp/status/619523126519574528) and started this one.
